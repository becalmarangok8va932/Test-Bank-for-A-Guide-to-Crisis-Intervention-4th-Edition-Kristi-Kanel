Author: Kristi Kanel
This four edition of Dr. Kristi Kanel's A GUIDE TO CRISIS INTERVENTION covers the fundamentals of situational and developmental crises, how they occur, and how they have been managed since the 1940s. Kanel discusses traditional counseling models as they relate to crisis intervention, and shows how they have been incorporated into her model-the ABC Model of Crisis Intervention-that is used by both paraprofessionals and professionals. Presented in detail, the ABC Model of Crisis Intervention is ideal for use in any mental health setting and with any individual (from any population) in a crisis situation. The text provides detailed examples of specific crisis situations, including developmental crises, trauma crises, post traumatic stress disorder crises (PTSD), crises of personal victimization, substance abuse crises, and crises related to loss, terminal and serious illness, and disabilities. New chapters discuss veterans' issues; sexual assault and rape; and ethical, legal, and professional issues. The author also explores suicide assessment and the use of the Mental Status Exam. Every chapter offers case vignettes to aid students in practicing the skills presented in the ABC Model of Crisis Intervention.
